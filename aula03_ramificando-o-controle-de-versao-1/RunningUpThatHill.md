# Running up that hill
- Cantora: Kate Bush

## LETRA: 
It doesn't hurt me. <br>
Do you want to feel how it feels?<br>
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?<br>
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?<br>
You, it's you and me.<br>

If I only could,<br>
I'd make a deal with God,<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places,<br>
Be running up that road,<br>
Be running up that hill,<br>
Be running up that building.<br>
If I only could, oh<br>

You don't want to hurt me,<br>
But see how deep the bullet lies.<br>
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.<br>
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.<br>

Is there so much hate for the ones we love?<br>
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?<br>
You, you and me.<br>
It's you and me won't be unhappy.<br>

If I only could,<br>
I'd make a deal with God,<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places,<br>
Be running up that road,<br>
Be running up that hill,<br>
Be running up that building,<br>
If I only could, oh<br>

C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,<br>
Let me steal this moment from you now.<br>
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,<br>
Let's exchange the experience, oh<br>

And if I only could,<br>
I'd make a deal with God,<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places,<br>
Be running up that road,<br>
Be running up that hill,<br>
With no problems.<br>

If I only could,<br>
I'd make a deal with God,<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places,<br>
Be running up that road,<br>
Be running up that hill,<br>
With no problems.<br>

If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>

If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>

If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
If I only could,<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
