# Bitter Sweet Symphony
- Banda: The Verve
 
## LETRA:  
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life<br>
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die <br>
I'll take you down to the only road I've ever been down <br>
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah<br>

No change, I can change<br>
I can change, I can change<br>
But I'm here in my mold<br>
I am here in my mold<br>
But I'm a million different people<br>
from one day to the next<br>
I can't change my mold<br>
No, no, no,no, no<br>
(Have you ever been down?)<br>

Well, I've never prayed, but tonight i'm on my knees, yeah<br>
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah <br>
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now <br>
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now<br>

No change, I can change <br>
I can change, I can change <br>
But I'm here in my mold <br>
I am here in my mold <br>
And I'm a million different people <br>
From one day to the next <br>
I can't change my mold <br>
No, no, no, no, no <br>
(Have you ever been down?) <br>
I can't change it you know <br>
I can't change it <br>

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life <br>
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die<br>

You know I can change, I can change <br>
I can change, I can change <br>
But I'm here in my mold <br>
I am here in my mold <br>
And I'm a million different people <br>
From one day to the next <br>
I can't change my mold <br>
No, no, no, no, no <br>
I can’t change my mold <br>
No, no, no, no, no <br>
I can’t change my mold <br>
No, no, no, no, no <br>
You’ve gotta change my mold<br>
No, no, no<br>

(It’s just sex and violence, melody and silence) <br>
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence) <br>
(Gotta can’t change my violence, melody and silence) <br>
(I’ll take you down the only road I've ever been down) <br>
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence) <br>
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)<br>
(Gotta, can’t change my violence, melody and silence)<br>

(Been down)<br>

(Can’t change my violence, melody and silence)<br>
(Ever been down)<br>
(Ever been down)<br>
(Ever been down)<br>

(Have you ever been down?)<br>
(Have you ever been down?)<br>
(Have you ever been down?)<br>
(Have you ever been down?)<br>
(Have you ever been down?)<br>

(Lord, yeah, babe, Lord, Lord, take me on my way takes me, now, yeah) <br>
